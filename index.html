          Several actors made statements expressing their sorrow at Ledger's
          death, including Daniel Day-Lewis, who dedicated his Screen Actors
          Guild Award to him, saying that he was inspired by Ledger's acting;
          Day-Lewis praised Ledger's performances in Monster's Ball and
          Brokeback Mountain, describing the latter as "unique, perfect". Verne
          Troyer, who was working with Ledger on The Imaginarium of Doctor
          Parnassus at the time of his death, had a heart shape, an exact
          duplicate of a symbol that Ledger scrawled on a piece of paper with
          his email address, tattooed on his hand in remembrance of Ledger
          because Ledger "had made such an impression on [him]". British indie
          band Kasabian paid tribute to Ledger in their song 'Vlad the Impaler',
          with the line "Joker, meet you on the other side". Singer Tom Meighan
          often changes the word "Joker" to either "Ledger", or the names of
          recently deceased celebrities.
